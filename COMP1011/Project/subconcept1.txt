R-value

R-squared is a measure of how well a linear regression model fits the data. 
It can be interpreted as the proportion of variance of the outcome Y explained by the linear regression model.

It is a number between 0 and 1. 
The closer its value is to 1, the more variability the model explains. 
And R2 = 0 means that the model cannot explain any variability in the outcome Y.

On the other hand, the correlation coefficient R is a measure that quantifies the strength of the linear relationship between 2 variables.

r is a number between -1 and 1 :
- A value of r close to -1: negative correlation between the variables (when one increases the other decreases and vice versa)
- A value of r close to 0: 2 variables are not correlated (no linear relationship exists between them)
- A value of r close to 1: positive linear relationship between the 2 variables (when one increases, the other does)

r-value measures the extent of accuracy of the calculated line.
r = sum of(Xi-average x)(Yi-average y)/square root of(sum of (Xi-average X)^2*sum of(Yi-average Y)^2)
