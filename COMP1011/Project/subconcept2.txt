Sub-concept 2
Multiple Linear Regression
Model: yi = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x2 + n.
In regression analysis, if there are two or more independent variables, it is called multiple regression. 
In fact, a phenomenon is often associated with multiple factors. 
It is more practical to predict the dependent variable by the optimal combination of multiple independent variables than to use only one independent variable. 
Therefore, multiple linear regression is more practical than one linear regression.

How to calculate:(using least squares estimation again to two-variable regression model)
∑y = n * b0 + b1 * ∑x1 +b2 * ∑x2
∑(x1 * y) = b0 * ∑x1 + b1 * ∑(x1 * x1) + b2 * ∑(x1 * x2)
∑(x2 * y) = b0 * ∑x2 + b1 * ∑(x1 * x2) + b2 * ∑(x2 * x2)
And then solve these three equation
